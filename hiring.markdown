Two years ago we started on our goal to make programming better with [Light Table][lt]. Now we're working on bringing programming to everyone with Eve.

As it exists today, programming is [unnecessarily complex][tbp] and [obtuse][pwf]. It takes years of dedicated training to tell a computer what to do, but being able to do so is nothing short of a modern day superpower. We want to put that power in the hands of [everyone][ltas], not by dumbing programming down, but by finding the right [foundation][itms] upon which it should sit.

It's a problem that touches every aspect of computing from compilers and databases to human-computer interaction and cognitive science. To find a solution, we're revisiting foundational research, imagining what computation should be, and testing our ideas with actual humans.

We're a small team in San Francisco and we're looking for a few others who are willing to go way outside the box with us. If this sounds like your cup of tea, send us an email at [jobs@kodowa.com](mailto:jobs@kodowa.com). We'd love to talk.
