# Relational Algebra for the Eve Programmer

The foundation of Eve is relational algebra, which is just a way of saying that Eve works by computing relations between data (that's the relational bit) in a well-defined way e.g. through the use of symbols with clear semantic meaning (and there's the algebra). For you, the Eve programmer, we've abstracted away most of the relational algebra that would be invovled in writing Eve programs. Thus, you don't really need to be an experat at relational algebra to write Eve programs, in the same way you don't need to be an expert in lambda calculus to write Haskell. 

But at its core, Eve runs on relations, so having an understanding of what relational algebra is and how to use it will make you a better Eve programmer.   

## Relations

## Set Operations

Just as regular algebra relies on standard arithmetic operations like addition or multiplication, relational algebra relies on set theoretic operations including union, intersection, and more. This is a whole topic unto itself, which we've covered in [Sets for the Eve Programmer](http://localhost).
