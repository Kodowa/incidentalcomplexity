# Solving Problems in Eve

When approaching a brand new langauge, sometimes it is hard to figure out the "right way" to do things. Obviously with a general purpose langauge, a given problem can be solved in any number of ways. But as language designers, we have built the syntax with certain usage patterns in mind, which makes some solutions more straightforward than others.

The purpose of this document is twofold. One, we will spell out style guidelines that, while cosmetic in nature, are aimed at making Eve code consistent, clear, and readable. Second, we will demonstrate the canonical, idomatic ways to approach certain common patterns in Eve.
