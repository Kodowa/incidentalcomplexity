#### Querying with Grids 

So now let's look at the really interesting bit. Take a look at this:

In this example, proximity to other cells has meaning. So the cell `person` means select all the entities tagged `person`. The adjacent cell `age` means select the attribute `age` for that colletion i.e. `person.age`. Building under that, we select `person.name` and `person.friend`. Taking it further, we can select attributes on `person.friend` e.g. ther names and ages. (note: we call them Name2 and Age2 so that they are not bound to the previously used name and age)

This was very exciting for us, because you could basically write out a complicated query with no syntax, since cell proximity holds semantic meaning. This was by far the fastest way to write a query yet. Here's how writing one of these queries works:
