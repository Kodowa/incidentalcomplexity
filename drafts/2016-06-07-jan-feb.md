At the start of 2016 we decided it was about time for another "release". I say "release" since we are developing in the open (for now, that's happening on our [Github](http://www.github.com/witheve)


 In January, our cadence was still very research-focused, but it had been almost 6 months since we [released V0](http://www.chris-granger.com/2015/08/17/version-0/). So we targeted February to showcase our next direction for public consumption.

### Platform Work

In October, Chris wrote a new runtime in Typescript for his CardWiki experiment. Our V0 runtime was written in Rust, which was fine except for the distribution part of the story; with Typescript, we could ship the runtime to the client's browser and have it do all the work. This was a lot easier compared to having the user download and install rust, compile the runtime, and then compile and connect to a server.

We also defined syntax for Eve, which would allow us to write queries before we had a UI ready. The syntax was very lisp-y, and was based on Josh's DSL work he did in Copperfield. 




### Natural Language Querying

As if Eve wasn't enough work already, we decided to add a




`Corey's age`

```
(query
	(select "eavs" :entity "corey" :attribute "age" :value corey|age)
	(project! :age corey|age))
```

`sum salaries`

```
(query
	(select "eavs" :attribute "salary" :value salary)
	(select "sum" :sum output0 :value salary)
	(project! :sum output0))
```

`total salary per department`

```
(query
	(select "tags" :entity department :tag "department")
	(query
		(select "eavs" :entity employee :attribute "salary" :value employee|salary)
		(select "eavs" :entity employee :attribute "department" :value department)
		(select "tags" :entity employee :tag "employee")
		(select "tags" :entity department :tag "department")
		(select "sum" :sum output0 :value employee|salary))
	(project! :sum output0 :department department))
```


`count the number of moons per planet`

```
(query
	(select "tags" :entity planet :tag "planet")
	(query
		(select "directionless links" :entity moon :link planet)
		(select "tags" :entity moon :tag "moon")
		(select "tags" :entity planet :tag "planet")
		(select "count" :count output0))
	(project! :count output0 :planet planet))
```
