In a [recent thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/eve-talk/jeZXVg10LYs) on our mailing list (if you're not part of our mailing list, you should [join](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/eve-talk)!), I posed some questions to the Eve community: why are you following Eve? What do you find interesting about Eve? What kind of impact do you hope Eve will have? Now, as an introduction to who we are, let's hear from the Eve team.

### Chris Granger ([ibdknox](https://github.com/ibdknox)) - CEO

### Robert Attorri ([ibdthor](https://github.com/ibdthor)) - President

### Josh Cole ([joshuafcole](https://github.com/joshuafcole)) - Engineer

### Corey Montella ([cmontella](https://github.com/cmontella)) - Engineer

I discovered Eve late in 2014. At the time, I was knee-deep in robotics Ph.D. at Lehigh University.

### Eric Hoffman ([convolvatron](https://github.com/convolvatron)) - Engineer
