[TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) is a [specification](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/app-spec.md) for a todo list web application. Its original purpose was to help developers evaluate the plethora of Javascript frameworks implementing the Model-View-Controller design pattern. Today, it has evolved into a benchmark for programming languages and frameworks targeting the web. TodoMVC is a great application to demonstrate Eve's capabilities, as our semantics naturally enable a concise implementation; without optimizing for line count, the program you're reading only contains 63 lines of Eve code, which is the shortest implementation we've come across (if you know of one shorter, let us know!).

This program is divided into three sections mirroring the MVC framework: The Model section covers the underlying data model used to populate the user interface. Then, the View section talks about how the data is displayed for the user. Finally, the Controller section covers how user input affects the data.

## Model

For the model, we don't need to formally specifying anything; the model is implicitly defined according to what we use in the View and Controller. But let's look at the main record that drives the app. At its core, TodoMVC displays a todo list, so we'll model todos with the following record:

```
[#todo body completed editing]
```

Every todo is tagged `#todo`. They each have a `body`, which is the text of the todo entered by the user. Additionally, each todo has two flags. The `completed` flag affects how the todo is displayed, and allows the user to filter todos based on completed status; we can look at only completed todos, active todos, or all todos. The editing flag is used to toggle an editing mode on the todo, allowing the user to update the body text.

These todos exist in the context of an `@app`. This record is commonly used to hold global state information. In our case, we use it to place a filter on the todos. The filter can be one of "completed", "active", or "all".

## View

We draw Todo MVC here. All styling is handled in a separate CSS file. The app consists of three parts:

1. Header - Contains the `@toggle-all` button as well as `@new-todo`, which is an input box for entering new todos.
2. Body - Contains `@todo-list`, the list of todos. The work here is handled in the second block.
3. Footer - Contains the count of todos, as well as control buttons for filtering, and clearing completed todos.

In this block, we do a little work to determine todo-count, all-checked, and none-checked. Other than that, this block simply lays out the major control elements of the TodoMVC app. A key aspect of this block is the `bind` keyword. This denotes the beginning of the action phase of the block, and tells Eve that to update records as data changes. This is the key component enabling Eve to update the View based on user interactions.

```
  match
    [@app filter]
    all-checked = if not([#todo completed: false]) then true
                  else false
    none-checked = if [#todo completed: true] then false
                   else true
    todo-count = if c = count[given: [#todo completed: false]] then c
                 else 0
  bind
    [#link rel: "stylesheet" href: "/examples/todomvc.css"] // Links to an external stylesheet
    [#div class: "todoapp" children: [#header children: [#h1 text: "todos"]
        [#input @new-todo, class: "new-todo", autofocus: true, placeholder: "What needs to be done?"]
        [#input @toggle-all, class: "toggle-all", type: "checkbox", checked: all-checked]]
      [#div class: "main" children:
        [#ul @todo-list, class: "todo-list"]]
      [#footer children:
        [#span @todo-count, class: "todo-count", children: [#strong text: todo-count] [#span text: " items left"]]
        [#ul @filters, class: "filters", children:
          [#li children: [#a href: "#/all" class: [selected: is(filter = "all")] text: "all"]]
          [#li children: [#a href: "#/active" class: [selected: is(filter = "active")] text: "active"]]
          [#li children: [#a href: "#/completed" class: [selected: is(filter = "completed")] text: "completed"]]]
        [#span @clear-completed, class: [clear-completed: true, hidden: none-checked], text: "Clear completed"]]]
```

Here is where the main Todo list lives. We attach it to `@todo-list` using its child attribute. Each `#todo` consists of:

- a list item, with a checkbox for toggling the completed status of the todo
- a label displaying the text of the todo
- an input textbox for editing the text of the todo
- a button for deleting the todo

```
  match
    [@app filter]
    (todo, body, completed, editing) =
      if filter = "completed" then ([#todo, body, completed: true, editing], body, true, editing)
      else if filter = "active" then ([#todo, body, completed: false, editing], body, false, editing)
      else if filter = "all" then ([#todo, body, completed, editing], body, completed, editing)
    parent = [@todo-list]
  bind
    parent.children += [#li, class: [todo: true, completed, editing], todo, children:
                         [#input #todo-checkbox, todo, class: [toggle: true, hidden: editing], type: "checkbox", checked: completed]
                         [#label #todo-item, class: [hidden: editing], todo, text: body]
                         [#input #todo-editor, class: [edit: true, hidden: toggle[value: editing]], todo, value: body, autofocus: true]
                         [#button #remove-todo, class: [destroy: true, hidden: editing], todo]
```

Thanks to Eve's set semantics, we don't need any loops here; for every unique `#todo` in the database, Eve will do the work of adding another `#li` as a child of `@todo-list`. 

## Controller

When the `@new-todo` input box is focused and the user presses enter, the value of the input is captured and a new todo is created.

```
  match
    element = [@new-todo value]
    kd = [#keydown element, key: "enter"]
  commit
    [#todo body: value, editing: false, completed: false, kd]
    element.value := ""
```

Here we can handle all the instances where we edit a todo.

- click `#todo-checkbox` - toggles the completed status of the checkbox.
- click `@toggle-all` - marks all todos as complete or incomplete, depending on the initial value. If all todos are marked complete, clicking `@toggle-all` will mark them complete. If only some are marked complete, then clicking `@toggle-all` will mark the rest complete. If all todos are marked as complete, then clicking `@toggle-all` will mark them all as incomplete.
- blur `#todo-editor` - blurring the `@todo-editor` will cancel the edit 
- escape `#todo-editor` - this has the same effect as blurring
- enter `#todo-editor` - commits the new text in `#todo-editor`, replacing the original todo

```
  match
    (todo, body, editing, completed) =
      if [#click element: [#todo-checkbox todo]] then (todo, todo.body, todo.editing, toggle[value: todo.completed])
      else if [#click element: [@toggle-all checked]] then ([#todo body], body, todo.editing, toggle[value: checked])
      else if [#double-click element: [#todo-item todo]] then (todo, todo.body, true, todo.completed)
      else if [#blur element: [#todo-editor todo value]] then (todo, value, false, todo.completed)
      else if [#keydown element: [#todo-editor todo] key: "escape"] then (todo, todo.body, false, todo.completed)
      else if [#keydown element: [#todo-editor todo value] key: "enter"] then (todo, value, false, todo.completed)
  commit
    todo <- [body, completed, editing]
```

Deleting a todo from the list is accomplished by removing the `#todo` tag from the todo's record. The todo still exists in the database, but since the `#todo` tag is gone, it will no longer be displayed in the list of todos.

```
  match
    todo = if [#click element: [#remove-todo todo]] then todo
           else if [#click element: [@clear-completed]] then [#todo completed: true]
  commit
    todo -= #todo
```

The TodoMVC specification requires filtering via the URL. This is actually how the filter buttons work; if you look at their href attributes, they modify the URL with certain tags:

- all - displays all todos
- active - displays active todos only
- completed - displays completed todos only

We can extract this value using `#url`, which has a hash-segment attribute that automatically parses the URL for us, returning the value (expected to be any one of the above). Any other value won't result in any todos being showed, but the application will not break.

```
  match
    value = if [#url hash-segment: [index: 1, value]] then value
            else "all"
  bind
    [@app filter: value]
```
