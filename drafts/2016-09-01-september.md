#### Word Choice Adjustments

In August, we tentatively settled on the term "context" in place of "bag" to describe a partition of facts. After testing "context" for a couple weeks, we came  to the conclusion that it just wasn't the right word. It just didn't fit the concept. Instead, we've decided on "database", which is a much more obvious and standard choice. We've found that "database" engenders an intuition close to the actual concept.

bag -> context -> database
