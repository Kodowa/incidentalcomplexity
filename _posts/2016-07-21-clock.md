A clock example is pretty much the "Hello World" of reactive applications. It's got all the right pieces: some event stream which changes over time, and a way to present those changes 
visually. Here is our version:

![A Clock in Eve](https://github.com/witheve/assets/blob/master/images/eveclock.gif?raw=true)

This clock is written in the Eve developer syntax, which is proposed in our first [Request for Comments (RFC)](https://github.com/witheve/rfcs/blob/master/proposed/syntax.md). In this post, I'll go through the code and explain how it works.

### Eve code

Eve code is written as a series of blocks, each of which can be thought of as operating in two phases:

- Phase 1: Collect objects from the Eve DB
- Phase 2: Mutate objects in the Eve DB

This pattern repeats in each of the blocks. The clock program consists of two blocks: the first generically defines a clock hand, while the second defines the clock itself. Let's focus on each block in turn.

### Draw a clock hand

```
draw a clock hand
 // Select all the clock hands
 hand = [#clock-hand angle length]

 // Eve will maintain the following objects            
 maintain         

    // Calculate x1, y2, x2, y2 for each hand                            
    hand := [#line, x1: 50, y1: 50,

            // using angle and length            
            x2: 50 + (length * sin(angle)),  
            y2: 50 - (length * cos(angle))]
```

Blocks themselves have a [structure](https://github.com/witheve/rfcs/blob/master/proposed/syntax.md#block-structure). First, any line indented at least once is treated as code, while any line with no intention is treated as a comment. This has the nice effect of being able to write documentation about the functionality of the program, with code blocks interspersed throughout.

Next, we enter the [collect phase](https://github.com/witheve/rfcs/blob/master/proposed/syntax.md#phase-1-collect) of the block. The collect phase here is a single line, where we find our first [object](https://github.com/witheve/rfcs/blob/master/proposed/syntax.md#objects):

```
hand = [#clock-hand angle length]
```

Objects are a set of attribute:value pairs enclosed in square brackets. They ask Eve to find all the entities that match the supplied attribute shape. The `hand` object here is asking Eve to find every object [tagged](https://github.com/witheve/rfcs/blob/master/proposed/syntax.md#tag-selector---) `#clock-hand` that also has the attributes `angle` and `length`. Since we’ve just given the name of the attributes here, we can use them as variables later in the program e.g. `sin(angle)`.

Now we enter the [mutate phase]() of the query, indicated by the use of the `maintain` fence. This fence says that we are finished reading from the Eve DB, and now we are ready to write to it. The use of the `maintain` fence in particular says that as data changes, Eve will keep their dependant objects up-to-date. This is the first feature that enables the reactivity of the program (the clock hands change position as the time changes):

```
 hand := [#line, x1: 50, y1: 50,            
           x2: 50 + (length * sin(angle)),  
           y2: 50 - (length * cos(angle))]
```

Here, `:=` is the `set` operator, one of three [mutation opaertors](https://github.com/witheve/rfcs/blob/master/proposed/syntax.md#mutation-operators) (the other two being add `+=` and remove `-=`). The set operator sets the attributes of the target object to the supplied values, overwriting any previous values on the attribute. Here, the attributes being set are the `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2` coordinates of the clock hand.

That's all this block does: it selects every `#clock-hand`, and tags each one as a `#line`, which Eve knows how to draw. In the next block, we define the clock as a clock face with `#clock-hands`.

### Draw a clock

```
draw a clock
 // Select the current time
 [#time hours minutes seconds]   
                                     
 // Update the SVG as the time changes
 maintain        
       
    // Add an SVG element to the root of the DOM                                              
    [#svg viewBox: "0 0 100 100", width: "300px", children: 

     // Add a clock face at (50,50) with radius 45.           
     [#circle cx: 50, cy: 50, r: 45, fill: "#0B79CE"]  
           
     // Add the hours hand    
     [#clock-hand angle: 30 * hours, length: 30, stroke: "#023963"]

     // Add the minutes hand   
     [#clock-hand angle: 6 * minutes, length: 40, stroke: "#023963"]

     // Add the seconds hand  
     [#clock-hand angle: 6 * seconds, length: 40, stroke: "#ce0b46"]] 
```

The second block (as with all blocks) follows the familiar collect -> mutate pattern. For this block's collect phase, we are selecting the `#time` object, with its attributes `hours`, `minutes`, and `seconds`. This object is just like any other, but under the covers Eve keeps it up to date as the system clock changes. Then Eve updates every object that depends on time and so on.

After the `maintain` fence, we draw some SVG:

```
[#svg viewBox: "0 0 100 100", width: "300px", children: ... ]
```

Since no parent is specified, the SVG element is attached to the root of the DOM. Next, we draw some elements inside of the SVG box by adding them as children. We add the clock face (a blue circle at (50,50) with radius 45): 

```
[#circle cx: 50, cy: 50, r: 45, fill: "#0B79CE"] 
```

and three hands:

```
[#clock-hand angle: 30 * hours, length: 30, stroke: "#023963"]
```

This is where the current block ties back into the previous one. We're adding an object with the tag `#clock-hand` and attributes `angle` and `length`. This is exactly the pattern we were matching against in the first block! Thus, the loop is completed, and the clock hands are drawn as lines based on the current time as an angle.

### Try it yourself!

You can download Eve and try the clock yourself! The quickest way is to use our docker container: `docker pull witheve/eve`

But you can also download the Eve source and build it yourself: `git clone https://github.com/witheve/Eve.git`. Instructions to build are available on the [witheve/eve repository](https://github.com/witheve/Eve).
