_(Eve is a new programming language, and this is our development blog. If youâ€™re new to Eve, [start here](play.witheve.com))_

In [September][0.1], we were busy prepping for the launch of Eve. This work carried over into October, and we released Eve v0.2 on October 28. Thank you to everyone who gave Eve a try and sent us your comments and criticisms. We've read hundreds of comments on [HN][0.2], Reddit, and the mailing list, so November is really focused on how to address these and what's the right path to move Eve forward. But let's talk more about what we did in October!

### Eve alpha v0.2

Again, the biggest news from October was the release of Eve v0.2 (alpha) out into the wild. We put up a lot of content on [programming.witheve.com](programming.witheve.com), explaining our vision, the major highlights of Eve, and some discussion on 

We also made a nice video, showing how we think Eve could be useful in a development context:

Of particular note here is the roadmap for Eve, which provides a general direction of where we are headed:

- **Milestone 1: Programming for humans (We are here)** - This milestone is about the language, semantics, syntax, and editor -- the basis of Eve on which everything else will be built. Right now we're focusing on fleshing out the langauge, building the standard library, defining what it means to work with Eve for a project, figuring out how Eve fits in with existing projects, connecting Eve to different data sources, deploying Eve programs, etc.

- **Milestone 2: The World Scale Computer** - Eve is a distributed system by default. In the 0.2 release, we've turned a lot of that off, but the next big release will be about how Eve programs scale and distribute to multiple machines.

- **Milestone 3: Computation for all** - This final milestone is the furthest out, requiring us to revisit our [experimental work](https://github.com/witheve/eve-experiments) in end-user computing, and turning that into a real product for non-programmers. We've explored many ideas here, some more promising than others, but we still don't have the right answer for what this looks like. So, we'll be doing a lot more research before we can complete this milestone. One thing to note here, is we're not calling this milestone "programming for all". That's intentional, for really two reasons:

  1. We don't believe a product like this will resemble programming at all as it exists today. Will it be [graphs](http://incidentalcomplexity.com/2015/10/15/jul-sept/)? A [grid](http://incidentalcomplexity.com/2016/06/03/oct-nov/)? A [wiki](http://incidentalcomplexity.com/2016/06/10/jan-feb/)? We're not sure, but it will be exciting to find out.

  2. Most people don't actually want to program, as we think of the task today. We don't anticipate that the general population will want to use Eve to write traditional applications. Instead, we think Eve will be appealing to them for its ability to aggregate, transform, and distribute data to answer questions. Today, these are tasks you have need an experienced developer to accomplish. We don't think it has to be that way.
  
### Platform

As we teased last month, the Eve platform has moved over to a TypeScript codebase. This was really a tactical move than anything else. One of the main motivating factors was that with TypeScript, we could run Eve in the browser without any setup. Even better, it allows us to collect statistics on usage and engagement. Providing a zero friction programming experience is what we are trying to do, and there was just a lot of friction with the C runtime.

That's not to say we will be abandoning the C runtime. The TS runtime will act as a reference implementation, so Eve can be implemented in other languages and work as a cohesive system. Therefore, the C runtime will be a key component of our second milestone.

#### Editor

The biggest changes to the platform were in the editor. We've already looked at the TOC and the editing experience, which have been polished a little more since September. Let's look at some other changes though:

##### The Inspector

The inspector is activated via the magic wand icon at the top of the editor. This toggles inspection mode, which allows you to click on any block in your program or element in your application, and get some info about it.

The inspector tool is a sort of one-stop-shop for all your debugging needs. If an area of your program isn't displaying, the inspector can tell you why. If you see too many elements (or too few), the inspector will tell you how they came to be. If your program is running slowly, the inspector will tell you which blocks are consuming the most processing time:

##### Views

To this point we've been using `bind @browser [#div text]` as a sort of `console.log()` for Eve. This process is pretty antithetical to Eve, when you think about it. First, we've known for a long time now that drawing the result of a computation _spatially near_ the computation is very powerful for debugging. Second, many things you don't want to visualize as text. You can't `console.log()` a bar-graph, for example.

Enter views. Views are a way to visualize a block's output right under the block itself. By writing data into the `@view` database, you can visualize it as chart, or even a time-series:

And of course we support plain text views:

The nice thing about both the inspector and views is that they are implemented entirely in Eve! The following links open in the Eve editor:

- [The analyzer](http://play.witheve.com/#/examples/analyzer.eve) (drives the inspector)
- [The inspector](http://play.witheve.com/#/examples/inspector.eve)
- [Views](http://play.witheve.com/#/examples/view.eve)

Some people rightfully pointed out that most of our codebase isn't written in a literate style, which is something we have to address if our message is to be taken seriously. These components are a good start, but in the future, we'll be extending this practice to our entire codebase (to the extent that we can. After all, our argument is that other languages don't let you do this), whether it's written in Eve or not.

### Community

First, I'd just like to say the response to Eve has been fantastic so far. The mailing list has seen a lot more activity recently, and a 30% increase in membership since the launch, so that's great. Beyond the volume, though, we've also gotten some very detailed and thorough proposals, comments, and even some great pull requests and bug reports. Hopefully we can keep up this momentum, so spread the word!

### Blog

We've moved the blog to a new home: [blog.witheve.com](blog.witheve.com). Our former location, [incidentalcomplexity.com](incidentalcomplexity.com) will still be available, but if you have any bookmarks lying around, you should update them to the new domain.

#### Handbook

The Eve handbook has been moved to [docs.witheve.com](http://docs.wietheve.com). The style now matches the Eve editor more closely, and you can now start to imagine how docs and Eve can work side by side. As always, there is an endless amount of work to do here, so keeping the docs up to date will be an ongoing process. If you find any docs that are missing, outdated, or insufficient, please let us know by submitting an issue here: https://github.com/witheve/docs/issues.

#### Eve Around the Web

We made a little splash on the web that generated some discussions and stories. Here are the launch day discussion threads: 

- [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12817468)
- [/r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/59vddn/eve_programming_designed_for_humans/)
- [/r/compsci](https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/59x0b3/eve_programming_designed_for_humans/)
- [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/eve-4)

And even better, some user-generated videos and blogs about Eve! These were fascinating to read and watch, so thanks everyone for taking the time to make these.
