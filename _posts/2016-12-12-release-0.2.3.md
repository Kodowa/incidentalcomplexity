_(Eve is a new programming language, and this is our development blog. If youâ€™re new to Eve, [start here](http://play.witheve.com))_

We released v0.2.2 just last week, and already we're bumping the version number again, probably for the last time before we take a long-needed Holiday break. To recap, in v0.2.2 we added support for the Eve npm package, which adds the ability to use project workspaces, run stand-alone Eve apps, and run Eve in server execution mode. Read the [November Dev Diary](http://incidentalcomplexity.com/2016/12/06/november/) for a closer look at these recent changes.

### What's new in Eve Alpha v0.2.3?

Eve Alpha v0.2.3 includes these changes, and [more](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/releases/tag/v0.2.3). Let's see what's new:

#### Share Eve Programs with Gist

You can now share and load Eve programs with a link. There are two new icons in the editor at the top of the navigation pane: "Save to Gist" on the left, and "Load from Gist".

![new editor buttons]({{ site.url }}/images/saveload.PNG)

Clicking the "Save to Gist" button will upload your Eve program to a new [Gist](https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/) and provide you with a link to it:

![save to gist]({{ site.url }}/images/savegist.gif)

You can copy this link and send it to a friend, who can then load your program using the "Load from Gist" button. Clicking this button will reveal an input box, into which you can paste Gist links:

![load from gist]({{ site.url }}/images/loadgist.gif)

When you load a Gist, you get a local copy of the linked Eve program. Any edits to this program will be made locally, and saved in your project workspace.

#### Embed CSS Directly in Eve Programs

With a big thanks to the work of [dwsmorris](https://github.com/witheve/eve/pull/580), you can embed CSS blocks into Eve documents. In the editor, you can create CSS blocks with the WYSIWYG toolbar:

![css blocks]({{ site.url }}/images/embeddedcss.gif)

In a text editor, you can specify a css block in the info string

~~~eve
# CSS blocks

Print a greeting

```
commit @browser
  [#div class: "greeting" text: "Hello World"]
```

style the greeting

```css
.greeting {
  color: #FF0000;  
}
```
~~~

#### Standard Library

- Added [`fix[]`](http://docs.witheve.com/handbook/math/fix/) function (thanks [@Cormac-Williams](https://github.com/Cormac-Williams)!)
- Added [`join[]`](http://docs.witheve.com/handbook/strings/join/) aggregate
