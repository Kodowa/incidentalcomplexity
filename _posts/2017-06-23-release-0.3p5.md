_(Eve is a new programming language, and this is our development blog. If youâ€™re new to Eve, [start here](http://witheve.com))_

We're releasing Preview 5 of Eve v0.3 today. This isn't a huge release, but it contains some critical bug fixes, so if you're using Preview 4, you'll want this right away.

## What's New?

### Eve Starter

Since more people are using `eve-starter`, we've implemented two development streams so we don't break your work inadvertently.

- [release](https://github.com/witheve/eve-starter/tree/release) - Our npm module will be based of this branch, and we will inform you ahead of time of any breaking changes that we make.
- [nightly](https://github.com/witheve/eve-starter) - We will be actively pushing to `eve-starter/master`, so if you want to work with the bleeding edge of Eve, work from this branch. This does mean that your work might break without warning though.

We've updated the [readme](https://github.com/witheve/eve-starter) with instructions on how to work with these branches.

As a side note, if you are updating a current installation of Eve v0.3 (preview 4 or earlier) you need to delete `package-lock.json` in your `eve-starter` directory, or you will not be able to upgrade:

```sh
rm -r node_modules
rm package-lock.json
```

### Platform

We made a couple fixes to the Eve platform:

- Action lookups in the syntax now support dynamic attributes - [[849](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/pull/846)]
- Fixed an issue with aggregates and grouping, which would cause blocks using them to fail - [[856](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/pull/856)]
- Fixed unterminated record/quote errors - [[848](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/pull/848)]
- Prevent exception from program which parses no code blocks - [[850](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/pull/850)]
- Fixed double-printing first line on error spans that start at the beginning of the block - [[848](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/pull/848)]
- Better error message for non-fixpoint - [[847](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/pull/847)]
- Add a custom error message for values without attributes in a record - [[845](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/pull/845)]

### Renderer

- Enables using `html.addExternalRoot()` to control SVG placement - [[846](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/pull/846)]
- Enables mixing SVG into HTML documents - [[846](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/pull/846)]

### Library

For the first time, the standard library now has a baseline of [documentation](http://docs.witheve.com/v0.3/handbook/libraries/stdlib/). The documented libraries include aggregates, math, strings, HTML, canvas, UI, and system.

We've also changed/added the following:

- added the [`math/pow[]`](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/blob/master/src/runtime/stdlib.ts#L191) function -  - [[856](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/pull/856)]
- added the [`math/convert-base[]`](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/blob/master/src/runtime/stdlib.ts#L211) function -  - [[856](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/pull/856)]
- ([BREAKING](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/eve-talk/SF_ittD0nU8)) - adjusted the attributes on [`#system/timer`](http://docs-next.witheve.com/v0.3/handbook/libraries/stdlib/#system):
    - fixed `day` attribute on timer to report the day of the month, not the day of the week - [[853](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/pull/853)]
    - added `weekday` and `millisecond` attributes - [[853](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/pull/853)]
    - changed `frames` to `tick` - [[855](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/pull/855)]
