I just pushed 0.6.7, which while a small release has a few important bug fixes. There's been a weird seemingly random issue with saving and sometimes evaling that forced you to switch tabs to get things correct again. That has finally been tracked down and fixed. Proxy support was added, initial load of workspace behaviors was fixed, and creating a clojure client by selecting a project.clj has been cleared up to. Thanks to everyone who contributed!
