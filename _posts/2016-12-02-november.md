_(Eve is a new programming language, and this is our development blog. If youâ€™re new to Eve, [start here](http://play.witheve.com))_

With the launch of Eve v0.2 at the end of October, the early weeks of November were spent reacting and responding to feedback from new users to the ever-growing Eve community.

### What's new in Eve Alpha v0.2.2?

For a full list of the changes, check out the [release notes][1.1]. We've got several much-requested features in there for you. Let's take a look at those in detail.

#### Eve npm package

We published a package for Eve on npm, so you can now install Eve like so:

```
npm install -g witheve
``` 

This will give you a global Eve installation that you can invoke with the command `eve` from anywhere. Doing so will start an Eve server, in the same way `npm start` currently does.

#### Workspaces

We're introducing the ability to run Eve in a custom project workspace. To create a new Eve project workspace, just create a folder with an empty file named `package.json`. Now, start Eve from within this folder. Eve recognizes that it's starting in an Eve project, and will serve *.eve files from within this directory instead of the Eve examples folder. 

Furthermore, you can serve various assets for your Eve programs. Eve currently looks for the following folders in your project, and will serve files from them:

- `/css` - for serving stylesheets
- `/assets` - for serving images and other binary assets
- `/fonts` - for serving custom fonts 

#### Server Mode

Now, Eve can be started in server mode using the `--server` flag:

```
eve --server
```

Without this flag, execution of Eve programs happens within the browser, with the Eve server acting as an intermediary between the browser and your local system. In server mode, Eve will instead execute your program on the server. Currently written programs will operate exactly as before, but this is a preliminary step in order to get networked Eve applications going (like a chat server, or a multiplayer game). There is still work needed to be done there (currently [in review](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/pull/620)), so stay tuned for more!

#### Deploying Eve Apps

This is one of the most requested features to date, so we're happy to bring it to you. You can now run Eve applications without the editor, which should pave the way to deploying them on your own server. You can specify which Eve program you want to run after the Eve command:

```
eve ~/myEveDir/clock.eve
```

Now you can navigate to Eve in your browser to access the specified program. If you like, you can also recover the editor with a flag:

```
eve ~/myEveDir/clock.eve --editor
```

This will run the clock program with the editor visible.

#### Standard Library

The standard library still needs a lot of work, but thanks to our intrepid community, we made some great progress on adding basic functionality.

- Added support for the vast majority of HTML/SVG tags (thanks [@frankier](https://github.com/frankier)!)
- Added keydown event
- Added change event
- Added `urlencode[]` (thanks [@renegr](https://github.com/renegr)!)
- Achieved parity with Javascript math library functions and constants (thank [@Cormac-Williams](https://github.com/Cormac-Williams)!)

There's still a lot of work to do here, so let us know if you're missing some basic functions that could easily be added. 

### Community

It's been a month now since the launch of Eve, and we've been thrilled and excited by the response so far. It seems like I say this with every new dev diary, but every day we receive more issues, pull requests, and especially Eve programs that are getting more sophisticated every time.

With a fast growing community, though, it's tough staying on top of everything, especially with a small team like ours (we're only 4 developers here, if you didn't know!). Thankfully, our great community has been picking up the slack, answering questions on the mailing list, tracking down issues, identifying and implementing improvements, reviewing pull requests... the list goes on. So a very special thanks goes out to our contributors this month:

#### Eve Around the Web

A member of the community, [L]iron Shapira](https://twitter.com/liron), has been writing a series about Eve on the website Hackernoon. It's a 6 part series, with parts 1-4 out now:

1. [How Eve unifies your entire programming stack](https://hackernoon.com/how-eve-unifies-your-entire-programming-stack-900ca80c58a7#.z1byg1g2r)
2. [When logic programming meets CQRS](https://hackernoon.com/when-logic-programming-meets-cqrs-1137ab2a5f86)
3. [Throwing off our scope chains](https://hackernoon.com/throwing-off-our-scope-chains-7567beb2d0b6)
4. [Smalltalk and protein programming](https://hackernoon.com/smalltalk-and-protein-programming-4da245ac93e2)

Parts 5 and 6 should be coming later this month. The first post in the series got a little attention on HN, so you can [read the comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13010396) if you're interested.
