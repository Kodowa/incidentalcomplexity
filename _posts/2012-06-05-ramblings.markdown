I love doing presentations and I'm happy to say that we have a few for [Light Table][lt] lined up throughout the year:

* 6/7/2012 - [Bay Area Clojure Meetup][meetup]
* 7/19/2012 - [OSCON][osc]
* 9/23/2012 - [Strange Loop][stl]
* 11/7/2012 - [Oredev][ore]

The Clojure meetup will be a really informal demo of [Light Table][lt] with most of the time spent on Q&A, while the others are more normal talks. I'll let you know if any more crop up!
