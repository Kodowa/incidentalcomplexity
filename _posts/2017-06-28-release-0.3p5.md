_(Eve is a new programming language, and this is our development blog. If youâ€™re new to Eve, [start here](http://witheve.com))_

We're releasing Preview 5 of Eve v0.3 today. This isn't a huge release, but it contains some critical bug fixes, so if you're using Preview 4, you'll want this right away. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/witheve/eve-starter), or [download the code directly](https://github.com/witheve/eve-starter/archive/release.zip).

## What's New?

### Eve Starter

Since more people are using `eve-starter`, we've implemented two development streams so we don't break your work inadvertently.

- [release](https://github.com/witheve/eve-starter/tree/release) - This branch will be in sync with the witheve npm module.
- [nightly](https://github.com/witheve/eve-starter) - We will be actively pushing to `eve-starter/master`, so if you want to work with the bleeding edge of Eve, work from this branch. We'll warn of breaking changes on the community Slack, but more formal notice of breaking changes will only come when we package a release.

We've updated the [readme](https://github.com/witheve/eve-starter) with instructions on how to work with these branches.

Due to changes in the way npm works, if you are updating a current installation of Eve v0.3 (preview 4 or earlier) and you have a `package-lock.json` file in your `eve-starter` directory, you will need to delete this file in order to upgrade:

```sh
rm -r node_modules
rm package-lock.json
```

If you don't have this file, you are fine.

### New Libraries

We've got three new libraries for you today: notify, [file](http://docs-next.witheve.com/v0.3/handbook/libraries/stdlib/#file), and [console](http://docs-next.witheve.com/v0.3/handbook/libraries/stdlib/#console).

- **notify** - Provides a configurable notification banner for displaying info, alerts and errors.
- **file** - Provides facilities for accessing the filesystem. This library can only be used when Eve is running in headless mode.
- **console** - Allows you to write messages to console log, warn, and error.

## Changelog

- Fixed unterminated record/quote errors - [[848](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/pull/848)]

### Library

For the first time, the standard library now has a baseline of [documentation](http://docs.witheve.com/v0.3/handbook/libraries/stdlib/). The documented libraries include aggregates, math, strings, HTML, canvas, UI, system, file, and console.

We've also changed/added the following:

- added the [`math/pow[]`](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/blob/master/src/runtime/stdlib.ts#L191) function - [[856](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/pull/856)]
- added the [`math/convert-base[]`](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/blob/master/src/runtime/stdlib.ts#L211) function - [[856](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/pull/856)]
- added the `#notify` library - [[859](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/pull/859)]
- added the `#file` library - [[858](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/pull/858)]
- added the `#console` library - [[858](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/pull/858)]
- ([BREAKING](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/eve-talk/SF_ittD0nU8/Jyy8mL8nAQAJ)) - adjusted the attributes on [`#system/timer`](http://docs-next.witheve.com/v0.3/handbook/libraries/stdlib/#system):
    - fixed `day` attribute on timer to report the day of the month, not the day of the week - [[853](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/pull/853)]
    - added `weekday` and `millisecond` attributes - [[853](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/pull/853)]
    - changed `frames` to `tick` - [[855](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/pull/855)]
    - changed `hours`, `minutes`, and `seconds` to `hour`, `minute`, and `second` - [[855](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/pull/855)]
