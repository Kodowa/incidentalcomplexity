Happy to announce a new, and fairly big, release of [Light Table][lt] today! The highlight of this release comes from moving LT to [CodeMirror 4][cm], which gives us multiple cursors, tons of performance improvements, and a few other little editing niceties. Here's a list of the new multiple cursors commands:

* Editor: Set selection to top most cursor
* Editor: Clear multiple cursors
* Editor: Insert line after
* Editor: Insert line before
* Editor: Select next occurrence of word
* Editor: Select between brackets
* Editor: Select scope
* Editor: Go to bracket
* Editor: Swap line up
* Editor: Swap line down
* Editor: Join lines
* Editor: Duplicate line
* Editor: Sort lines
* Editor: Sort lines insensitive
* Editor: Select lines upward with multiple cursors
* Editor: Select lines downward with multiple cursors
* Editor: Split selection into cursors per line

We had tons of contributions, so thanks so much to all of you for the pull requests and refinements you have all put in! Here's the full changelist:
